# Nushell 0.87.0

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

<!-- TODO: write this excerpt -->
Today, we're releasing version 0.87.0 of Nu. This release adds...

# Where to get it

Nu 0.87.0 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.87.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.
